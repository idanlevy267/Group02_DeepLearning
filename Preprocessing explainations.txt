Ireland News Headlines - Data Preprocessing & Visualization

This repository contains the first part of the final project for a university NLP + RL deep learning course. The initial phase is dedicated to preprocessing and visualizing the dataset 'ireland-news-headlines.csv', which contains 1.61 million news headlines from the Irish Times covering a quarter of a century. The goal of the overall project is to build a deep learning model that predicts the headline category given the headline text.

Dataset:
The dataset, retrieved from Kaggle, includes three fields:

1.publish_date: The date when the article was published in yyyyMMdd format.
2.headline_category: Category of the headline, Ascii, dot-delimited, and lowercase values.
3.headline_text: Title of the article in English in UTF-8 charset.

An example row from the dataset:

publish_date	headline_category	headline_text
19960102	news	UUP sees possibility of voting Major out

Preprocessing:
Preprocessing involved cleaning, organizing, and simplifying the dataset to make it suitable for training the model. The steps include:

1.Conversion of all letters to lowercase.
2.Deletion of duplicated rows.
3.Conversion of the publish_date column into three separate columns: day, month, and year.
4.Removal of rows with null values.
5.Reduction and organization of headline categories.
6.Counting unique words and their frequencies in the dataset.
7.Analyzing the distribution of headline lengths.
8.Text preprocessing steps like tokenizing words, removing punctuation, stop words, and applying lemmatization.

Category Balancing:
An important preprocessing step was to balance the dataset as the initial category distribution was skewed. The categories were split into two groups, one was oversampled, and the other was under-sampled, to make the distribution balanced.

Visualization:
The notebook includes multiple visualizations that provide insights into the data, such as:

1.Distribution of unique words in the dataset.
2.Distribution of headline lengths.
3.Distribution of categories in the dataset before and after balancing.
4.Pareto Chart of Words Frequency by Proportion

Future Work:
The subsequent phase of this project will involve choosing and training a suitable pre-trained model, compressing the trained model using three different methods, and selecting the optimal compressed model for deployment.
